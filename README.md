# CLRS
C++ implementation of CLRS 4/e example codes and exercise for studying purpose. Non-coding involved exercises will not be shared.

# How to use
1. Prepare a C++ compiler that supports most of C++20 (as of 2022.04, only MSVC 19.29+ works in the major implementations)
2. Prepare CMake
3. For example, to run Problem 2.1, copy and paste ```02_getting_started/problems/2-1_insertion_sort_on_small_arrays_in_merge_sort.cpp``` to ```main.cpp```
4. Run!
